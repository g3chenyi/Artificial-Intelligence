1. the implementation of two constraint propagators â€“ a Forward Checking constraint propagator, and
a Generalized Arc Consistence (GAC) constraint propagator,
2. the encoding of two different CSP models to solve the logic puzzle, Futoshiki, as described below.
In one model you will use only binary not-equal constraints, while in the other model you will use
9-ary all-different constraints in addition to binary not-equal constraints.
